# Logistic Regression

## Overview

This folder contains two notebooks that demonstrate the use of logistic regression for classification tasks. Logistic regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for binary and multi-class classification.

### 1. Single-Class Logistic Regression

- **Description**: This notebook covers logistic regression for binary classification. A user-created dataset is used to demonstrate how logistic regression can predict outcomes based on one or more independent variables.
- **Objective**: To showcase the process of implementing logistic regression for a single class, covering data preparation, model building, training, and evaluation.

### 2. Multi-Class Logistic Regression (Bank Loan Dataset)

- **Description**: This notebook applies logistic regression to a multi-class classification problem using the bank loan dataset. The goal is to classify multiple loan approval statuses based on input features.
- **Objective**: To illustrate the extension of logistic regression to handle multi-class problems and demonstrate techniques such as data preprocessing, model fitting, and evaluation for multi-class classification.
