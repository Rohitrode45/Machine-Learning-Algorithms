# Lab 1: Introduction to Machine Learning Libraries

## Overview

This notebook introduces essential libraries used in machine learning:

- **NumPy**: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. It forms the backbone for numerical data handling in Python.

- **Pandas**: A versatile library that simplifies data manipulation and analysis, offering powerful tools for handling structured data (e.g., data frames). It enables easy data import, cleaning, and transformation.

- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is commonly used to visualize data through charts, graphs, and plots, aiding in data analysis.

- **Scikit-learn**: A comprehensive library for machine learning that includes simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It provides various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and model evaluation.
